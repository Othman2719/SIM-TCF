# App Icons

Place your application icons in this directory:

- `icon.png` - For Linux (512x512 recommended)
- `icon.ico` - For Windows (256x256 recommended)  
- `icon.icns` - For macOS (512x512 recommended)

You can generate these icons from a single PNG file using online tools or electron-icon-builder.

For now, the app will work without icons, but they're recommended for a professional look.
